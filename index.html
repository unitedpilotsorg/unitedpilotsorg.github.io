        <h1>Welcome to the United Pilots Forum</h1>
    </header>

    <p>With the ratification of UPA23, the United Pilots Forum is now closed.</p>

    <p>The decision to close the forum was arrived at after careful consideration and consultation among the administrators. This forum was created in the wake of the middle-of-the-night suspensions from other forums of several critics of the way that UAL ALPA business was being conducted. When union officials are allowed to operate under the cover of darkness, the result is the Tumi TA. Thanks to your engagement and unity, that has been replaced by UPA23.</p>

    <p>Please be assured that your voices have been heard, and your contributions greatly valued. We urge you to stay united and connected through alternative avenues as we continue to advocate for our shared interests.</p>

    <p>In unity,</p>

    <p>Dave Behncke</p>
